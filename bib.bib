  abstract = {Past research in shock wave lithotripsy (SWL) has shown that cavitation plays an essential role in the comminution of kidney stones. To provide a better understanding of the role of cloud cavitation dynamics in SWL, the flow in the focal region of a lithotripter was modeled using an ensemble averaged two-phase flow model for the bubbly mixture combined with a high-order accurate shock capturing technique. The domain and initial conditions used in the numerical model reflect the appropriate dimensions and intensity of a Dornier HM3 electrohydraulic lithotripter. The impact of factors such as the size and number of bubble nuclei in the liquid, the intensity of the shock wave and the pulse rate frequency (PRF) on the cavitating flow field is analyzed. Conclusions regarding the impact of these parameters on the potential for stone comminution are also presented.},
